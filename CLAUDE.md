# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Pokemon Pokedex application built with Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. Features a Ruby/Sapphire-inspired game design with modern responsive layout and comprehensive multilingual support.

**Current Status**: Production-ready Pokemon Pokedex with comprehensive detail pages, enhanced evolution chains, performance optimizations, and sidebar-based generation navigation. Pokemon detail pages use SSG for optimal performance with individual Pokemon data pre-generated at build time. Pokemon list pages use full client-side rendering with intelligent cache system for seamless generation switching. Hybrid deployment fully operational with frontend deployed on Vercel and backend on Railway. **Language support optimized to 2 languages (English and Japanese) for maximum Vercel build performance** - static pages reduced from 12,537 to 2,786 (78% reduction). All dictionary files preserved for Korean, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese for future re-enablement. Icon system consolidation completed using react-icons library (Heroicons v2 for UI elements, Font Awesome for specialized symbols) for consistent styling, better accessibility, and improved maintainability. Pokemon classification system fully implemented with multilingual badge support (Baby→ベイビィ, Legendary→伝説, Mythical→幻) across both supported languages, comprehensive animation system with 26 distinct effects including classification-based hover animations, and enhanced sandbox environment with categorized animation testing. Recent improvements include Pokemon cache system optimization with enhanced UTF-8 character encoding for Japanese Pokemon names, server-side Pokemon service enhancements with intelligent caching strategies, resolution of animation cleanup issues ensuring smooth user experience, virtual scrolling implementation with react-window for large datasets (threshold: 10+ Pokemon), dynamic header shrinking system with smooth GSAP animations that preserves search functionality through icon display, streamlined search interface with simplified input mechanism eliminating dropdown suggestions for improved UI stability and performance, complete move data multilingual support with tooltip-based descriptions using react-tooltip, damage class localization through dictionary system, and data source annotations. Generation 0 (Other) implementation now includes centralized blacklist system for excluding Pokemon forms without sprite data, enhanced Pokemon form ID display and sorting functionality based on base Pokemon species ID for improved user experience, proper form-to-species mapping with intelligent caching for optimal performance, scroll position restoration system with session storage persistence for seamless navigation experience, and optimized user interface with hidden generation information in footer and loading screens for cleaner presentation. Pokemon badge system fully refactored with Strategy Pattern implementation for improved maintainability, unified color schemes for all badge types, and centralized badge logic in utility functions. Generation 0 URL parameter persistence and scroll position restoration system fully implemented with enhanced navigation that preserves user context when transitioning between detail and list pages. Enhanced progress footer system with GSAP-powered linear progress bar animations, continuous display from loading start to completion, and smooth state transitions during batch loading operations. Placeholder Pokemon images now use lightweight SVG Data URLs with "?" symbol instead of external PNG files, eliminating Next.js Image Optimization API errors and reducing build size by 1.2MB. **Redis cache removed** in favor of cost-effective localStorage (client) and CDN caching (server) strategy, with Cache-Control headers for 24-hour TTL and rate limiting for PokeAPI protection. **Vercel build optimizations** include custom vercel.json configuration, parallel generation builds, and TypeScript incremental compilation.

### Language Navigation
- Use `href="{/${language}/}"` instead of `href="/"` in navigation components
- Extract current language using `usePathname()` and `getLocaleFromPathname()`
- Language toggle is dropdown menu with upward positioning for better mobile UX

### Mobile/Tablet UI
- Touch targets are minimum 44px for accessibility compliance
- Hamburger menu with `bg-black/30` overlay for optimal visibility
- Tab count indicators hidden on mobile with `hidden sm:inline-flex`

### Generation Switching & Cache Management

## Cache Architecture (Redis Removed)

### Current Caching Strategy
The application now uses a cost-effective dual-layer caching approach:

1. **Client-side (localStorage)**
   - 24-hour TTL for Pokemon data
   - UTF-8 encoding for Japanese/Chinese characters
   - Automatic compression
   - 5 generation limit for storage management

2. **Server-side (CDN)**
   - Cache-Control headers: `public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800`
   - Vercel's automatic edge caching
   - No infrastructure costs

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - 50ms minimum interval between PokeAPI requests
   - Request monitoring and logging
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Benefits
- **Cost Reduction**: No Redis infrastructure costs
- **Performance**: localStorage provides instant data access
- **Simplicity**: Fewer moving parts and dependencies
- **Reliability**: No Redis connection issues

- **Custom Configuration**: `vercel.json` with optimized build settings and memory allocation
- **Parallel Generation Builds**: New script for building multiple generations concurrently
- **Function Timeouts**: Extended to 30 seconds for complex queries
- **Node Memory**: Increased to 8GB with `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable

#### Re-enablement Process:
To re-enable additional languages:
1. Update `Locale` type in `client/lib/dictionaries.ts`
2. Add languages back to `client/middleware.ts` locales array
3. Update `client/lib/get-dictionary.ts` dictionary imports
4. Restore language validation in `client/lib/languageStorage.ts`
5. Update `LANGUAGE_OPTIONS` in `client/lib/data/languages.ts`
6. Add metadata alternates URLs back to page components
7. Update all language-specific switch statements and conditionals

## Adding New Language Support

This section provides step-by-step instructions for adding a new language to the Pokemon Pokedex application.

### Prerequisites

1. Verify that the target language is supported by PokeAPI at https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/language/
2. Identify the PokeAPI language code (e.g., "de" for German, "it" for Italian)
3. Prepare comprehensive UI translations for the new language

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Create Language Dictionary File**: Create `client/lib/dictionaries/[lang].json` with all 400+ UI translations
2. **Update Type System**: Add new language to Locale type in `client/lib/dictionaries.ts`
3. **Configure Dictionary Loading**: Add language to `client/lib/get-dictionary.ts`
4. **Update Language Storage**: Modify validation functions in `client/lib/languageStorage.ts`
5. **Configure Routing**: Update `client/middleware.ts` to include new language
6. **Update Static Generation**: Add language to `generateStaticParams` functions
7. **Add Pokemon Data Integration**: Update `client/lib/pokemonUtils.ts` for Pokemon data fetching
8. **Update Language Toggle**: Modify `client/components/layout/LanguageToggle.tsx`
9. **Update All Dictionaries**: Add new language option to ALL existing dictionary files
10. **Update SEO Metadata**: Add alternate language URLs

### Technical Notes

- The system automatically fetches Pokemon data in the new language using PokeAPI's built-in language support
- If Pokemon data isn't available in the target language, the system falls back to English
- The generation cache system automatically supports new languages
- Both standard and generational build modes work with new languages
