## Development Commands

```bash
# Frontend development

## Key Features

### Implemented Features
- **Pokemon Display**: Card-based layout with official artwork and sprites
- **Type System**: Official Pokemon type colors and badges
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: 
  - Search by Pokemon name and ID with real-time results
  - Type-based filtering with visual type badges
  - Generation-based filtering (1-9) with region names (Kanto, Johto, etc.)
  - Auto-loading mechanism for generation filters to ensure complete results
- **Infinite Scroll**: Intersection Observer with debouncing and smart loading
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with client-side filtering and deduplication
- **Bilingual Support**: English/Japanese UI with proper translations
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop-first with mobile and tablet optimizations

### Search & Filter Implementation
- **Client-Side Filtering**: All filtering happens after data is loaded for instant results
- **Auto-Loading for Generations**: When generation filter is applied, automatically loads sufficient Pokemon to display all Pokemon from that generation
- **Filter Summary**: Shows active filters and result counts
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no results found

### Design System
- Ruby/Sapphire game-inspired UI components
- Official Pokemon type colors
- Responsive design (Desktop → Mobile → Tablet)
- Loading and error state designs
- Modern card-based layout

## Development Workflow

1. Always work on feature branches
2. Use conventional commit messages
3. Run type checking before commits
4. Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
5. Verify Pokemon data accuracy with official sources

## Technical Implementation

### State Management Architecture
- **Redux Toolkit**: Centralized state management with two main slices
  - `pokemonSlice`: Pokemon data, filters, and loading states
  - `uiSlice`: UI state including language, modals, and user preferences
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL client integration with Redux
- **Client-Side Filtering**: All filtering happens on cached data for instant results

### Search & Filter System
- **Search Types**: Name, ID, and exact match capabilities
- **Type Filtering**: Visual type badges with official Pokemon type colors
- **Generation Filtering**: 
  - Generations 1-9 with region names (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, etc.)
  - Auto-loading mechanism: automatically loads sufficient Pokemon to display all from selected generation
  - Progress indicators during auto-loading
- **Filter State**: Maintains active filters and result counts

### Data Loading Strategy
- **Infinite Scroll**: Intersection Observer API with debouncing
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Client-side deduplication in both Redux slice and hooks
- **Smart Loading**: Auto-loading for generation filters ensures complete datasets
- **Loading States**: Differentiated between regular loading and auto-loading states

### Generation Ranges
```typescript
const GENERATION_RANGES = {
  1: { start: 1, end: 151, region: 'Kanto' },
  2: { start: 152, end: 251, region: 'Johto' },
  3: { start: 252, end: 386, region: 'Hoenn' },
  4: { start: 387, end: 493, region: 'Sinnoh' },
  5: { start: 494, end: 649, region: 'Unova' },
  6: { start: 650, end: 721, region: 'Kalos' },
  7: { start: 722, end: 809, region: 'Alola' },
  8: { start: 810, end: 905, region: 'Galar' },
  9: { start: 906, end: 1025, region: 'Paldea' }
};
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Filter State Access
- When accessing filter state in components, ensure you import filters from Redux state:
  ```typescript
  const { filters } = useAppSelector((state) => state.pokemon);
  ```
- The `filters` object contains: `search`, `types`, and `generation` properties

### Runtime Errors
- "filters is not defined": Add filters selector to component (see above)
- Loading state conflicts: Check that auto-loading and regular loading states are properly differentiated

## External APIs

- **PokeAPI**: Primary data source for Pokemon information
- **GraphQL Server**: Custom wrapper for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Auto-Loading Logic**: Ensures complete generation datasets when filters are applied
