This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Pokemon Pokedex application built with Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. Features a Ruby/Sapphire-inspired game design with modern responsive layout and comprehensive multilingual support.

**Current Status**: Production-ready Pokemon Pokedex with comprehensive detail pages, enhanced evolution chains, performance optimizations, and sidebar-based generation navigation. **Pokemon detail pages use SSG** for optimal performance with individual Pokemon data pre-generated at build time. **Pokemon list pages now use full client-side rendering** with intelligent cache system for seamless generation switching - ISR removed to prevent generation data conflicts. **Intelligent generational build system** with automatic detection and memory-efficient processing by Pokemon generation. Major codebase cleanup completed with optimized component architecture and TypeScript compliance. **Mobile and tablet experience fully optimized** with responsive design, touch-friendly navigation, and enhanced UX across all screen sizes. **Hybrid deployment fully operational** with frontend deployed on Vercel and backend on Railway with CORS wildcard pattern matching for dynamic URLs. **Layout and scrolling optimization completed** with proper sidebar-to-content spacing, overlay positioning, and Pokemon grid scrolling functionality restored. **Generation switching completely fixed** - implemented full cache system with localStorage persistence, eliminated generation data mixing issues, and restored seamless Pokemon list loading across all generations. **UTF-8 character encoding issue fixed** - resolved Japanese Pokemon name corruption in card lists through base64 localStorage encoding with backward compatibility. **Comprehensive Redux dictionary support implemented** across all Pokemon detail child components with unified translation system using shared getFallbackText utility and complete i18n coverage for evolution conditions and sandbox components. **Next.js API Routes system fully implemented** - comprehensive REST API endpoints for Pokemon data access with GraphQL integration, multiple query types (basic/full), evolution chain analysis, debug capabilities, and dynamic Pokemon gender display based on PokeAPI data with color-coded symbols and enhanced multilingual localization. **Complete 8-language support implemented** - German (de) added to expand from 7 languages to 8 languages with comprehensive German translations, Pokemon data localization through PokeAPI GraphQL integration, generation/region names, type translations, game version names, and complete UI coverage including SEO metadata and alternate URLs. **German GraphQL Pokemon data integration completed** - all Pokemon utility functions (getPokemonName, getPokemonDescription, getPokemonGenus, getAbilityName, getMoveName) now properly fetch and display German Pokemon names, descriptions, classifications, ability names, and move names from existing GraphQL species.names, species.genera, species.flavorTextEntries, ability.names, and move.names data using PokeAPI language code "de" without requiring additional API calls. **Dictionary system architecture enhanced** - Sidebar and AnimatedLoadingScreen components converted from hardcoded language conditions to unified dictionary system for better maintainability and consistency. **Language toggle enhanced** - converted from cycling button to intuitive dropdown menu with upward positioning for better mobile UX, now supporting 8 languages with native German labels. **Evolution chain component architecture refactored** - 467-line monolithic component split into modular, reusable components (EvolutionCard, FormVariationCard, EvolutionArrow) with dedicated custom hook (useEvolutionAnimation) and utility functions, improving maintainability and code organization. **Pokemon component architecture fully organized** - 22+ Pokemon components systematically organized into logical folder structure with list/ and detail/ directories, improved import paths, and clear separation of concerns between Pokemon list page and detail page components for enhanced maintainability and developer experience. **FormUtils dictionary system integration completed** - Migrated getFormCategory() and getFormBadgeName() functions from hardcoded language switches to unified dictionary system, eliminating code duplication and ensuring consistent multilingual Pokemon form translations across all 8 supported languages with improved maintainability and type safety. **Next.js 15 Hydration errors completely resolved** - Systematically eliminated all SSR/CSR hydration mismatches by migrating 9 Pokemon detail components from Redux-dependent text rendering to props-based dictionary architecture, ensuring perfect server-client consistency across all 8 supported languages and preventing "読み込み中..." vs translated text conflicts during page hydration. **Pokemon card navigation speed fully optimized** - Comprehensive performance improvements using Next.js Link component with automatic prefetching, parallel animation processing, hover-based prefetching, Redux state optimization, and batch prefetching for visible cards, resulting in significantly faster click-to-navigation transitions while maintaining full particle burst and border echo animation functionality.

- **Smart ID Validation**: GraphQL-based detection of valid Pokemon IDs for detail pages
- **Build Performance**: Improved stability and reduced timeout errors with generation-based batching
- **Individual Generation Builds**: Support for building specific generations (build:gen-1 through build:gen-9)
- **Cache Benefits**: Client-side performance + generation data integrity + seamless switching

#### Build Commands & Automatic Detection
```bash
# Intelligent build (automatically detects mode)
npm run build  # Uses ENABLE_GENERATIONAL_BUILD environment variable

# Standard fast build (all generations at once)
npm run build:legacy

# Force generational build
npm run build:generational
ENABLE_GENERATIONAL_BUILD=true npm run build

# Specific generation build (development/testing)
npm run build:gen-1  # Generation 1 only (Kanto)
npm run build:gen-2  # Generation 2 only (Johto)
# ... through build:gen-9 (Paldea)

# Legacy commands (still work)
BUILD_GENERATION=1 npm run build:legacy
```

#### Automatic Build Mode Detection
The build system automatically chooses the optimal build strategy:
- **Standard Mode**: Fast build with all generations (default for development)
- **Generational Mode**: Memory-efficient build by generation (when `ENABLE_GENERATIONAL_BUILD=true`)
- **Single Generation**: Individual generation testing (development/debugging)

#### Environment Variables
- `ENABLE_GENERATIONAL_BUILD=true`: Enable generation-by-generation building
- `BUILD_GENERATION=X`: Build only specific generation (1-9) with legacy build
- Used in both Vercel production and local development environments

#### Vercel Production Setup
To enable generational builds in Vercel:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `ENABLE_GENERATIONAL_BUILD` = `true`
3. Deploy - the build system will automatically use generational mode
4. No changes to Build Command needed (uses `npm run build`)

#### Local Development Usage
```bash
# Test standard build (default)
npm run build

# Test generational build locally
ENABLE_GENERATIONAL_BUILD=true npm run build

# Test specific generation
npm run build:gen-1

# Compare build outputs
npm run build:legacy  # Standard
npm run build:generational  # Generational
```

### Internationalization
- **Languages**: Complete 8-language support (English/Japanese/Traditional Chinese/Simplified Chinese/Spanish/Korean/French/German) with middleware-based routing
- **Structure**: `/[lang]/` routes with server-side dictionary loading
- **Translation**: Pokemon names, types, abilities, moves, game versions, forms, and regions via PokeAPI integration with species.names[] data using language codes (en, ja, zh-Hant, zh-Hans, es, ko, fr, de)
- **Language Detection**: Intelligent detection with regional fallbacks (zh-TW→zh-Hant, zh-CN→zh-Hans, fr-fr/fr-ca→fr, de-de/de-at/de-ch→de)
- **UI Components**: All components support 8-language localization with unified dictionary system
- **Dictionary Architecture**: Components converted from hardcoded language conditions to dictionary-based translations for better maintainability
- **Form Translations**: Pokemon form badges (Mega, Gigantamax, Regional variants) in all 8 languages
- **GraphQL Data Integration**: Pokemon utility functions automatically fetch native language Pokemon data from PokeAPI GraphQL endpoints

### API Routes System
- **REST API Integration**: Next.js API Routes providing REST endpoints alongside GraphQL backend
- **Multiple Query Types**: Basic, Full, and Evolution-specific endpoints for optimized data fetching
- **Debug Capabilities**: GraphQL debug endpoints for testing and development
- **Endpoint Structure**:
  - `/api/pokemon` - Pokemon list with query parameters
  - `/api/pokemon/[id]` - Basic Pokemon detail data
  - `/api/pokemon/[id]/basic` - Explicit basic Pokemon data endpoint
  - `/api/pokemon/[id]/full` - Complete Pokemon data with evolution chains
  - `/api/pokemon/[id]/evolution` - Dedicated evolution chain analysis
  - `/api/graphql/debug` - GraphQL query testing and debugging
- **GraphQL Integration**: API Routes serve as REST layer over existing GraphQL backend
- **Environment Configuration**: Automatic GraphQL endpoint detection with fallback to localhost

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Generation Navigation State
- Use Redux state for current generation: `useAppSelector((state) => state.pokemon.currentGeneration)`
- Sidebar handles generation filtering and updates Redux state
- **Generation Filtering**: Client-side filtering of Pokemon based on generation selection
- **ISR Integration**: Server-rendered initial content with client-side filtering enhancement

### Language Navigation
- Use `href="{/${language}/}"` instead of `href="/"` in navigation components
- Extract current language using `usePathname()` and `getLocaleFromPathname()`
- **Language Toggle**: Dropdown menu with upward positioning for better mobile UX
- **4-Language Support**: English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese with native labels and flags

### Mobile/Tablet UI
- Touch targets are minimum 44px for accessibility compliance
- Hamburger menu with `bg-black/30` overlay for optimal visibility
- Tab count indicators hidden on mobile with `hidden sm:inline-flex`
- iOS Safari scroll optimization with `WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'`

### Container Overflow Management
- Main content containers use `overflow-auto` for proper scrolling
- Pokemon grid containers avoid `min-h-full` classes that prevent natural height
- Flex layouts with `flex-1` allow proper content distribution and scrolling

### Generation Switching & Cache Management
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Check localStorage cache before API requests for instant loading
- **Data Integrity**: Generation-aware data fetching prevents data mixing between generations  
- **Cache Persistence**: 24-hour TTL with automatic compression and smart cleanup
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Base64 localStorage encoding preserves Japanese and Chinese Pokemon names and prevents character corruption
- **Character Encoding**: Resolved `���シャマリ` → `オシャマリ` corruption in Japanese card lists through proper UTF-8 handling, supports Chinese characters
- **Silent Failover**: Timeout protection with graceful fallback to ensure seamless UX
- **Apollo Client Integration**: Standard fetchMore() patterns with automatic cache management
- **Cache Restoration**: Instant generation switching with cached data preservation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Automatic detection of legacy cache format with graceful migration

### SEO & Social Media Optimization
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Comprehensive Open Graph and Twitter Card implementation
- **Multilingual SEO**: Language-specific metadata for all 4 supported languages (English/Japanese/Traditional Chinese/Simplified Chinese)
- **Dynamic Images**: Daily rotating featured Pokemon images for social sharing
- **Canonical URLs**: Proper canonical and alternate language URL structure
- **Rich Snippets**: Optimized meta descriptions with Pokemon-specific information
- **Social Previews**: High-quality Pokemon artwork for attractive social media cards

### Performance Best Practices
- Run `npm run analyze` for bundle analysis before major releases
- Ensure image optimization settings are maintained in next.config.ts
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production environment
- Use priority loading for first 5 Pokemon cards in initial render

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Component testing with React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user flow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Bundle size and load time monitoring
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with enhanced type safety features
- **ESLint**: Extended Next.js configuration with custom rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting across the codebase
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated quality checks before commits

### SSR/CSR Hydration Optimization
- **Hydration Error Resolution**: Systematically eliminated Next.js 15 hydration mismatches across 9 Pokemon detail components by migrating from Redux-dependent text rendering to props-based dictionary architecture
- **Server-Client Consistency**: Ensured perfect synchronization between server-side rendered HTML and client-side React hydration across all 8 supported languages
- **Components Fixed**: PokemonDetailHeader, PokemonTypes, PokemonEvolutionChain, PokemonStorySection, PokemonVersionToggle, PokemonBasicInfoGrid, PokemonWeaknessSection, PokemonStatsSection, PokemonStatBar
- **Architecture Pattern**: Replaced `useAppSelector((state) => state.ui.dictionary)` with direct `dictionary` props to eliminate async Redux initialization timing issues
- **Fallback Strategy**: Removed server-side fallback text ("読み込み中...") that conflicted with client-side translated text during hydration
- **Props Flow**: Dictionary data flows from server components through props to ensure consistent text rendering between server and client
- **Type Safety**: Updated component interfaces to require Dictionary props while maintaining backward compatibility where needed

## Deployment Strategy

### Hybrid Architecture (Fully Operational)
- **Frontend**: Vercel (Next.js optimized platform) - DEPLOYED
- **Backend**: Railway (GraphQL + Redis) - DEPLOYED
- **Benefits**: Best-in-class hosting for each component, cost-effective, scalable
- **Status**: Production-ready with CORS wildcard pattern matching for dynamic URLs

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Frontend (Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/graphql

# Backend (Railway)
CORS_ORIGIN=https://*.vercel.app
PORT=4000
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Frontend deployment (automatic via Vercel)
git push origin main

# Backend deployment (automatic via Railway)
git push origin main  # Triggers Railway deployment

# Manual backend deployment
cd server && npm run build && npm start
```

### Production URLs
- **Frontend**: `https://pokemon-pokedex.vercel.app`
- **Backend**: `https://pokemon-pokedex-server.railway.app`
- **GraphQL Playground**: `https://pokemon-pokedex-server.railway.app/graphql`

### Monitoring & Health Checks
- Frontend: Vercel Analytics and Web Vitals
- Backend: Health endpoint at `/health`
- Redis: Connection status monitoring
- GraphQL: Apollo Server metrics

## External APIs

- **PokeAPI**: Primary data source for Pokemon information (v2 API)
- **Redis Cache**: Server-side caching with 5-minute TTL (Railway Redis or Upstash)
- **GraphQL Server**: Custom Apollo Server with intelligent caching (Railway/Render)
- **Apollo Client Cache**: Browser-side caching for efficient data management

## Adding New Language Support

This section provides step-by-step instructions for adding a new language to the Pokemon Pokedex application. The process has been streamlined through the unified dictionary system and PokeAPI GraphQL integration.

### Prerequisites

1. Verify that the target language is supported by PokeAPI at https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/language/
2. Identify the PokeAPI language code (e.g., "de" for German, "it" for Italian)
3. Prepare comprehensive UI translations for the new language

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Create Language Dictionary File

Create a new dictionary file in `client/lib/dictionaries/[lang].json`:

```bash
# Example for German (de.json)
cp client/lib/dictionaries/en.json client/lib/dictionaries/de.json
```

Translate all 400+ entries in the dictionary file, including:
- UI text (navigation, buttons, labels)
- Pokemon-related terminology (types, abilities, stats)
- Game version names
- Form translations (Mega, Gigantamax, Regional variants)
- Error messages and empty states
- Meta tags and SEO content

#### 2. Update Type System

Add the new language to the Locale type in `client/lib/dictionaries.ts`:

```typescript
export type Locale =
  | "en" | "ja" | "zh-Hant" | "zh-Hans" 
  | "es" | "ko" | "fr" | "it" 
  | "de";  // Add new language here
```

Update the Dictionary interface to include the new language option:

```typescript
language: {
  // ... existing languages
  german: string;  // Add new language option
}
```

#### 3. Configure Dictionary Loading

Add the new language to `client/lib/get-dictionary.ts`:

```typescript
const dictionaries = {
  // ... existing languages
  de: () => import("./dictionaries/de.json").then((module) => module.default),
};
```

#### 4. Update Language Storage

Modify `client/lib/languageStorage.ts` to support the new language in validation functions:

```typescript
// Update getStoredLanguage() validation
if (stored && (
  stored === "en" || stored === "ja" || /* ... existing languages ... */ ||
  stored === "de"  // Add new language
)) {
  return stored as Language;
}

// Update getLanguageFromCookie() validation  
if (value === "en" || value === "ja" || /* ... existing languages ... */ ||
    value === "de") {  // Add new language
  return value as Language;
}
```

#### 5. Configure Routing and Middleware

Update `client/middleware.ts` to include the new language:

```typescript
// Add to locales array
const locales = ["en", "ja", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "es", "ko", "fr", "it", "de"];

// Add User-Agent detection logic (optional)
const germanIndicators = [
  "de", "de-de", "de-at", "de-ch", "german", "deutsch", "deutschland", "germany"
];
```

#### 6. Update Static Generation

Add the new language to `generateStaticParams` functions:

**In `client/app/[lang]/layout.tsx`:**
```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return [
    // ... existing languages
    { lang: "de" },
  ];
}
```

**In `client/app/[lang]/pokemon/[id]/page.tsx`:**
```typescript
const languages = ["en", "ja", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "es", "ko", "fr", "it", "de"];
```

#### 7. Add Pokemon Data Integration

Update `client/lib/pokemonUtils.ts` to fetch Pokemon data in the new language:

```typescript
// Update all language mapping objects
const languageMap: Record<string, string[]> = {
  // ... existing languages  
  de: ["de"],  // Add PokeAPI language code
};

// Update language condition checks
if (language === "ja" || language === "zh-Hant" || /* ... existing ... */ || language === "de") {
  // Pokemon data fetching logic
}
```

#### 8. Update Language Toggle Component

Modify `client/components/layout/LanguageToggle.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add to LANGUAGE_OPTIONS array
const LANGUAGE_OPTIONS: LanguageOption[] = [
  // ... existing languages
  { value: "de", label: "Deutsch", flag: "🇩🇪" },
];

// Add to getLabel() function
const getLabel = () => {
  switch (language) {
    // ... existing cases
    case "de": return "Sprache";
    default: return "Language";
  }
};
```

#### 9. Update All Language Dictionaries

Add the new language option to ALL existing dictionary files:

```json
// In en.json, ja.json, etc.
{
  "ui": {
    "language": {
      // ... existing languages
      "german": "German"  // Translated appropriately for each language
    }
  }
}
```

#### 10. Update Metadata and SEO

Add alternate language URLs to `client/app/[lang]/pokemon/[id]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
alternates: {
  languages: {
    // ... existing languages
    de: `https://pokemon-pokedex-client.vercel.app/de/pokemon/${id}`,
  },
}
```

### Verification Checklist

After implementing the new language:

- [ ] Dictionary file created with complete translations
- [ ] TypeScript types updated (Locale, Dictionary interface)
- [ ] Dictionary loading configured
- [ ] Language storage validation updated
- [ ] Middleware routing configured
- [ ] Static generation parameters updated
- [ ] Pokemon utility functions support new language
- [ ] Language toggle component updated
- [ ] All existing dictionaries include new language option
- [ ] SEO metadata includes alternate URLs
- [ ] Test navigation to `/[new-lang]/` works
- [ ] Pokemon names, descriptions, and abilities display in new language
- [ ] UI text appears in new language
- [ ] Language toggle shows new option with correct label

### Technical Notes

1. **PokeAPI Integration**: The system automatically fetches Pokemon data in the new language using PokeAPI's built-in language support
2. **Fallback Logic**: If Pokemon data isn't available in the target language, the system falls back to English
3. **Cache Compatibility**: The generation cache system automatically supports new languages
4. **Build Compatibility**: Both standard and generational build modes work with new languages
5. **SSG Support**: Static site generation automatically creates pages for all supported languages

### Example: German Language Integration

The German language integration serves as a reference implementation:
- Language code: `"de"`
- PokeAPI support: Full (names, descriptions, abilities, moves)
- Dictionary entries: 400+ comprehensive translations
- Native labels: "Deutsch" for German, "Sprache" for language toggle
- Regional detection: Support for de-DE, de-AT, de-CH variants

This systematic approach ensures consistent, maintainable language support across the entire application.
